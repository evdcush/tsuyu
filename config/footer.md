**why this list?**

I like nature.

I like intelligence.

I like methods and models of intelligence inspired by nature.

This best-of format is a more accessible source of truth than stars, bookmarks, awesome lists, etc.

This project was built using the handy template from [**Best-of**](https://best-of.org).
It's a full turnkey template--does everything for you; it's great!
You simply need to update `projects.yaml`
