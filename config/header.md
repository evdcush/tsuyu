I like nature.

I like intelligence.

I like methods and models of intelligence inspired by nature.

This "best-of" list workflow helps me wrangle the amazing nature-inspired projects I've discovered on github.

There are {project_count} hella dope and libre projects.


🎏 TODO(evan):
this document tracks only some of the projects I have discovered through my reading.
Expand:

- all/current "nature" proj I've found (list has not been updated in... some time)
- properly organize the sections (currenty everything is dumped into the sole "Others" category)
- share resources for learning more about evolutionary computation and nature-inspired intelligence
- make a list of coo and inspo scientist peeps in this space
